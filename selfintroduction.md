* my job is to ensure that the applications are running smoothly and efficiently, that they are secure and relaiable
 
* i have strong undeerstanding of IAAC principle and tools like
version controle system(git), jenkins ,docker, k8s & also good knowledge on cloud services like ec2, iam , s3 , & elastic load balancer

* i am confident that i can bring a lot of value to any organization

* i am passionate about technology and i am always looking to improve performance of applications

* i am also a team player & enjoy working with others to achive a common goal

# CPU AND MEMORY UTILIZATION

## TOP

* top: The top command displays real-time information about system processes, including CPU and memory usage

## HTOP

* htop: Similar to top, htop provides an interactive process viewer that also displays CPU and memory usage.


## UPTIME

* uptime: The uptime command provides a snapshot of the system's load average and how long the system has been running since the last reboot

## FREE

* the amount of free and used memory in the system, including buffers and caches. Running free -h

## VMSTAT

* vmstat command reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity

## SAR

* sar: The sar command (System Activity Reporter)

## PS

* ps: The ps command can be used to list currently running processes.

* ps aux | grep
