### self intro

* My self hemalatha Bijam, i am from ongole , i Completed my mtech in 2019 at QIS college of engineering and technology.

* Over the past 4 years i worked with divers teams , Helping them streamline there software development process , by leveraging tools like git , jenkins , terraform , docker, azuredevops and kubernetes.

* i worked with aws services like ec2 , kms, elb , RDS and s3 buckts.

* as a devops engineer , i have designed , implimented and manage ci/cd pipeline by using azure devops and jenkins. CI/CD automates the build , test and deployment process resulting in faster and more reliable software releases.

* I write the dockerfiles for package the applications and there dependencies by using docker files , we build the docker images that images were pushed to container registries like ECR in aws.

* I have played a key role in container orchistration and management by using k8s , enabling teams to efficiently deploy and scale our applications.

* I have been involved IAC by using TF , allowing for Provisioning and management of resources in Declarative and version controle manner. we define entire Infrasructure stack including servers , databases and networking in a terraform configuration files .

* I starting (previous) days i worked on linux commands to change the permissions for files , users and groups . to set the environment paths to programming languages for application dependent packages and check the cpu and memory utlization .

* ater that i assigned to the CI/CD project . in these project we used some pluggings for configuration and package installations.

* Incase any build issues during the build time i will check the jenkins logs based on issue i will informed to respected teams (developes issues or QA platform ) we will debug the issues .

* comming to my project is

### CONTINUOUS DEPLOMENT OF MICROSERVICES BASED ON WEB APPLICATIONS

* in this project our main focus was to automate the CI/CD pipeline and the application consistes of multiple services includes front end , back end and db .

* the main goal of this project is to achive ci/cd leaveraging a combination of tools like github, jenkins , docker , sonarqube , nexus , ecr , owascp dependency check , terraform and kubernetes

* So , for this project we used Distributed version controle system that is git as virsion controle and we had set up a git repo to store the source code of each micro services .

* we have differeent brances for develop, testing and production releases . Our branching stategy we use is inspired from got flow brancing stratagy .

* we have configred jenkins to monitor git repositories for changes . we haveset up the automated builds triggerred by code commits and webhooks .

* Implimented unit tests & code quality checks as part of the CI pipeline . for scaning the source code and , wehave used static source code analysis tools like sonarqube scanner and trivy.

* we have written docker files for each microservices and we build the docker images . docker images were scanned to check the vulnerabilities using trivy & OWASCP dependency check is used t scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities .

after scanning the image pushed to container registries (ECR)

* NEXT , We have setup ks cluster by using terraform to manage the deployment of microservices .we have written Deployment files and service files for each microservices , where-in we define how the applications shud run inside the k8s cluster , including the desired state , replicas and other specifications of health probes , cpu and memory and restart polcies .

* integrated promethes and graphana for monitoring to check  the health and performance of microservices and infrastructure .

* implimanted regular automated backups of databases(mysqqldump) , auto-scalling confgurations for micro services based on traffic patterns , implimenting aws IAM role and policies to ensure least privilege access for users .

* Integrated jenkins with k8s to automatically deloy new container images to the cluster . in my organization we used rollingupdates .

* i worked with cross functional teams including developers , qa engineers and system administrators .fostering a culture of transperancy & knowledge sharing .

* we worked on diferent env like dev FIT (functional intigration testing) IAT (integration aceptance test ) UAT (user acceptance test) IPE (integration performance environment)

* incase we required the new services or new issues we will provisioning and install . we patching the packages of OS

* we will support to the developers we give the tool access like bit bucket and jenkins access . incase create any new environment we will do.


### day to day activities

*  First i wil check my mails ,  any issues reported to my team
 & any  meetings was sheduled for which time .

* and i  prepare my project status for synkup calls , in that call i explained about my project or tasks status , any resolving issues are discuss with them and ask some solutions .

* i worked on pending tasks

* devops is aware of the complexity that the use of numerous thechnologies can entail . that's why it regularly maintains documents concerning the tools , there implimentation and maintained .

* incase we will create new env we will do

* we required the new services or new issues we will provissioning and install.

* we support to the developers we give the tool access for jenkins access

* i maintained ci/cd pipeline , check logs on jenkins server . in these pipeline any build & deployment jobs was failed , i will improve my automation day to day for run and deployment process smoothly and efficiently.

* in case any build issues during build time i will check the jenkins logs based on that isssue i will informed to respected team (it's a developer issue or qa team platform issue we will debug the issues)
